            <p>It was a long journey, but I found hope in small things. Talking to friends and journaling helped me realize that I wasn't alone.</p>
            <p>At my lowest point, I reached out for help, and that changed everything. Therapy, exercise, and focusing on self-care played a huge role in my recovery.</p>
            <p>For anyone struggling, please know that help is available. You're stronger than you think.</p>
